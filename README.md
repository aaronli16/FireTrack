# 🔥 FireTrack – Wildfire Tracking & Community Platform  
**Live Demo:** [firetrack-80309.web.app](https://firetrack-80309.web.app)

FireTrack is a wildfire reporting and community engagement platform that empowers users to track local fire activity, share updates, and support relief efforts — all from one interactive map-based interface.

## 💡 Inspiration

The idea for FireTrack was sparked during the devastating LA wildfires. As I scrolled through Instagram, I noticed countless fundraisers being shared — but only because I happened to follow people affected by the fires. It struck me that these efforts weren’t centralized, and many others might never see or hear about them. That’s when I realized the need for a platform that not only tracks wildfires, but also brings people together through community updates and support tools. FireTrack aims to be that space — bridging the gap between information, action, and connection.
