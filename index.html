      <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
      <p>
        Wildfires are becoming a bigger problem around the world, with extreme
        fire events increasing by 5.4% per year 2001, according to the
        <a
          href="https://www.wri.org/insights/global-trends-forest-fires"
          title="Forest Fires Are Getting Worse"
          >World Resources Institute</a
        >. In places like California, wildfires have caused massive destruction.
        For example, the recent Los Angeles fires caused over
        <a
          href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-22/la-me-wildfire-costs-los-angeles-public-infrastructure"
          title="News about LA fires"
          >$350 million in damage to public infrastructure, including roads,
          utilities, and water systems</a
        >. These fires also displaced families, destroyed homes, and led to poor
        air quality that impacted millions of residents. Climate change has made
        fire seasons longer and fires stronger, leading to more than 345 million
        hectares of land burning every year. These fires harm communities,
        damage nature, and make air quality worse. However, people often don’t
        have quick, easy access to important information, like where fires are
        happening or where to evacuate. This lack of real-time information makes
        it harder for communities to stay safe and prepared.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some apps, like
        <a href="https://www.watchduty.org/" title="Watch Duty">Watch Duty</a>
        and
        <a href="https://www.alertwildfire.org/" title="AlertWildFire"
          >AlertWildfire</a
        >, try to help by tracking wildfires, but they have limits. They only
        cover certain areas, focus mostly on official updates, and don’t combine
        community reports with scientific data. These gaps leave people without
        the timely and reliable information they need to make quick decisions in
        emergencies. Our app will solve this problem by providing a more
        complete and accessible way for people to stay informed and prepared
        during wildfires.

      <h2>App Description</h2>
      <p>
        Our app is designed for those who are trying to save money or find
        environmentally friendly alternatives to their everyday groceries. We
        can help those who are budget-conscious, students, families trying to
        save money, or those in food deserts looking for affordable options. We
        will help reduce economic disparities in local communities.
      </p>

      <p>
        Users will be able to access our app on the web and search for grocery
        items they need. With our app, we will provide pricing data on stores in
        their area. Users will also be able to upload deals they found locally
        that might not have been on our website. By having this community
        feature, it will be easier for deals to be located. For those who are
        looking to not only save money, but the Earth as well, the app will have
        a feature that suggests environmentally friendly alternatives of the
        item that the user is looking at. To further help our users, they will
        be able to sort deals by discount.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our site will be using a fabricated dataset for this project in order to
        demonstrate the use of our idea. The dataset will consist of stores in
        their area, grocery items, their price, and a description of that item.
      </p>

      <p>
        By using the app, users will hopefully be able to plan out their grocery
        trips to save the most amount of money possible. In recent times,
        grocery prices have also been fluctuating, much to the dismay of many
        consumers, and with our app, we can help mitigate that by helping users
        to find the best deals automatically. Having a centralized app can also
        help users view deals in their area without having to go from website to
        website to find if their store has a good deal.
