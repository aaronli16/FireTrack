    <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
    <section>
    <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
    <p>Groceries being too expensive is a growing concern for many individuals and families trying to save money while making sustainable choices. 
        Grocery prices have risen significantly over the past few years, with food prices up 28% since 2019, according to <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/price-of-food" target = "__blank" 
        title="Read the NerdWallet article about food price increases">NerdWallet</a>. 
        Grocery prices vary across stores, and finding the best deals often requires shoppers to visit multiple stores or spend time researching prices online, one store at a time. 
        Additionally, customers who want to purchase eco-friendly products face challenges in identifying sustainable options, often needing to research each product or brand individually. 
        According to a <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/consumers-care-about-sustainability-and-back-it-up-with-their-wallets" target = "__blank"  
        title="McKinsey and NielsenIQ Study on sustainability and consumer behavior">
        McKinsey and NielsenIQ study</a>, 78% of US consumers say a sustainable lifestyle is important to them, and 60% are willing to pay more for sustainable packaging. 
        This demonstrates a clear need for an efficient solution that combines affordability and sustainability.</p>
    <p> Apps such as <a href="https://flipp.com/" target = "__blank" title="Explore Flipp's coupon and online ordering features">Flipp</a> try to address this problem by offering coupons and online ordering. 
        However, they don't explicitly compare prices across a user's local grocery stores and lack features to highlight eco-friendly products. 
        By creating this web app, we aim to bridge this gap, providing a tool that allows users to compare grocery prices across stores while also showcasing sustainable product options.
        Our app is designed to make grocery shopping an easier, more informed, and stress-free experience, empowering users to save money and make choices that align with their values. </p>

    <h2>App Description</h2>
    
    <p>Our app is designed for those who are trying to save money or find environmentally friendly alternatives to their everyday groceries. 
        We can help those who are budget-conscious, students, families trying to save money, or those in food deserts looking for affordable options. 
        We will help reduce economic disparities in local communities.</p>

    <p>Users will be able to access our app on the web and search for grocery items they need. With our app, we will provide pricing data on stores in their area. 
        Users will also be able to upload deals they found locally that might not have been on our website. By having this community feature, it will be easier for deals to be located. 
        For those who are looking to not only save money, but the Earth as well, the app will have a feature that suggests environmentally friendly alternatives of the item that the user is looking at. 
        To further help our users, they will be able to sort deals by discount.</p>

    <p>Our site will be using a fabricated dataset for this project in order to demonstrate the use of our idea. The dataset will consist of stores in their area, grocery items, their price, and a description of that item. </p>

    <p>By using the app, users will hopefully be able to plan out their grocery trips to save the most amount of money possible. 
        In recent times, grocery prices have also been fluctuating, much to the dismay of many consumers, and with our app, we can help mitigate that by helping users to find the best deals automatically. 
        Having a centralized app can also help users view deals in their area without having to go from website to website to find if their store has a good deal.</p>
