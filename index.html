    <h1>Project Proposal</h1>

    <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
    <p>Groceries being too expensive is a growing concern for many individuals and families trying to save money while making sustainable choices. 
        Grocery prices have risen significantly over the past few years, with food prices up 28% since 2019, according to <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/price-of-food" target = "__blank" 
        title="Read the NerdWallet article about food price increases">NerdWallet</a>. 
        Grocery prices vary across stores, and finding the best deals often requires shoppers to visit multiple stores or spend time researching prices online, one store at a time. 
        Additionally, customers who want to purchase eco-friendly products face challenges in identifying sustainable options, often needing to research each product or brand individually. 
        According to a <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/consumers-care-about-sustainability-and-back-it-up-with-their-wallets" target = "__blank"  
        title="McKinsey and NielsenIQ Study on sustainability and consumer behavior">
        McKinsey and NielsenIQ study</a>, 78% of US consumers say a sustainable lifestyle is important to them, and 60% are willing to pay more for sustainable packaging. 
        This demonstrates a clear need for an efficient solution that combines affordability and sustainability.</p>
    <p> Apps such as <a href="https://flipp.com/" target = "__blank" title="Explore Flipp's coupon and online ordering features">Flipp</a> try to address this problem by offering coupons and online ordering. 
        However, they don't explicitly compare prices across a user's local grocery stores and lack features to highlight eco-friendly products. 
        By creating this web app, we aim to bridge this gap, providing a tool that allows users to compare grocery prices across stores while also showcasing sustainable product options.
        Our app is designed to make grocery shopping an easier, more informed, and stress-free experience, empowering users to save money and make choices that align with their values. </p>
